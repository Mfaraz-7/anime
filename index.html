            <mark><b>Demon Slayer</b></mark> follows the story of a young boy named <i>Kamado Tanjiro</i>, who lives in the mountains with his parents and five siblings. One day, the boy went to sell charcoal in the village. When he returned, his house was destroyed and everyone was killed by a Demon. The only surviving member of the family was Kamado Nezuko, his younger sister, who turned into a Demon herself.Tanjiro fights relentlessly to find a cure for his sister. He becomes a Demon Slayer and fights alongside Inosuke Hashibira and Zenitsu Agatsuma. Throughout the Demon Slayermanga and anime, a few of Tanjiro's quotes sum up his character better than any others.In chapter <strong>107</strong> of the Manga, Muichiro Tokito runs through the forest back to the village. Suddenly, he comes across Kotetsu trying to fight a minion fish Demon. The Mist Hashira knows the young villager would die.<br>

            When the original <mark><b> Dragon Ball</b></mark> series begins, Goku has a nomad-like lifestyle where he lives in isolation. Goku explains that he was raised by a kindly old man named Gohan, who took him in as his own. Unfortunately, circumstances intervene, and Goku’s unusual background leads to Grandpa Gohan’s passing. Goku is a strong fighter, but he’s still just a child with extremely minimal real-world experience, so it’s surprising to see that he’s been able to survive on his own before he meets Bulma..Dragon Ball’s adventure truly begins once Goku heads off with Bulma to locate the remaining Dragon Balls. The whole reason that she runs into him is that her Dragon Radar detects Goku’s Four-Star Ball. This Dragon Ball is Goku’s lasting memory behind his Grandpa Gohan, but considering the importance of these orbs, it’s quite strange that Bulma is the first to come to his door looking for it. This contrivance is necessary for the anime’s story to begin, but Bulma is far from the only one aware of the Dragon Balls and their powers.

He gained his first bounty of Beli30,000,000 for defeating the strongest pirate captains of the East Blue, which then increased to Beli100,000,000 after defeating Crocodile in Arabasta. After his crew's invasion into and escape from Enies Lobby, his bounty was increased to Beli300,000,000. His sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Luffy.<br>
